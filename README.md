# rich-go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ibadus/rich-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ibadus/rich-go)

An implementation of Discord's rich presence in Golang for Linux, macOS and Windows.
\
### ‚ùóFork reason
I had issue with the original repo, when trying to build a windows binary on Linux, so I forked it and made some changes. 
\
I removed the [npipe](https://github.com/natefinch/npipe/tree/v2) (old) package to rather use [Microsoft implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/go-winio).
As the old package used syscalls directly, I wasn't able to build it on Linux nor MacOS.

## Installation

Install `github.com/ibadus/rich-go`:

```
$ go get github.com/ibadus/rich-go
```

## Usage

First of all import rich-go
```golang
import "github.com/ibadus/rich-go/client"
```

then login by sending the first handshake
```golang
err := client.Login("DISCORD_APP_ID")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

and you can set the Rich Presence activity (parameters can be found :
```golang
err = client.SetActivity(client.Activity{
	State:      "Heyy!!!",
	Details:    "I'm running on rich-go :)",
	LargeImage: "largeimageid",
	LargeText:  "This is the large image :D",
	SmallImage: "smallimageid",
	SmallText:  "And this is the small image",
	Party: &client.Party{
		ID:         "-1",
		Players:    15,
		MaxPlayers: 24,
	},
	Timestamps: &client.Timestamps{
		Start: time.Now(),
	},
})

if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```
